Bachelor's degree in Commerce and Marketing at Corvinus University of Budapest. 

<!-- truncate -->

I started my University studies right after finishing High School. I actually started it at the Human Resources Faculty, because I wanted to learn more about pshychology. 

However jobwise I was more interested in Marketing and found that the subjects and experts are closer to my interest within that area. I changed my faculty when I took a Marketing trainee position, and finished my University studies as an Economist with Marketing Faculty. 


:::note
Because of COVID-19 regulations the University didn't  allow the usual graduation ceremony to be held. A few months later I had the idea to have a photoshoot at least, so I contacted them. They kindly lent me the usual graduation attire, so me and a great friend of mine could take some images.
